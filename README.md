# Patientcare-AI-Agent
# Predictive Patient Care System - Agentic AI Implementation

## Overview
This project implements an **Agentic AI** system for predictive patient care in healthcare. The system consists of multiple intelligent agents working together to:
- Collect patient health data
- Predict health risks using machine learning
- Optimize treatment plans
- Continuously update the model based on new patient data
- Deploy the trained model for real-world use

## Agents and Their Roles
1. **Data Collection Agent** - Fetches real-time patient data.
2. **Risk Prediction Agent** - Uses machine learning to predict health risks.
3. **Optimization Agent** - Recommends optimal treatment plans.
4. **Learning Agent** - Updates the model with new patient data.
5. **Deployment Function** - Simulates deploying the model.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```
numpy
scikit-learn
requests
scipy
joblib
```
You can install them using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Program
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the main script**
   ```sh
   python agentic_ai_healthcare.py
   ```
4. **Expected Output**
   - The model will be trained and deployed.
   - A new patientâ€™s risk will be predicted.
   - A treatment plan will be recommended.
   - The model will be updated with new patient data and redeployed.

## Deployment Steps
- The model is trained and saved using `joblib`.
- The `deploy_model()` function simulates deployment.
- For real-world deployment, integrate with hospital systems or cloud services.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real healthcare APIs.
- Improved ML model with deep learning.
- Cloud-based deployment using AWS/GCP/Azure.
